# Advanced regression models: least squares, nonlinear, Poisson and binary logistic regression using R

Forthcoming chapter in _Data Science and Digital Business_, with Bill Fox.

## What we did:

We wrote a chapter in a forthcoming book on data science introducing and illustrating some key concepts in statistical analysis:

* Setting up an R workspace.
* Reading and pre-processing tabular data sets.
* Fitting a range of models to a variety of real-world data sets including continuous, binary, and count outcome data.
* Interpreting the outcome of statistical models and assessing model fit.
* Examining and diagnosing common modeling issues using residuals.
