# Cheap Talk, Costly Action: Using Verbal Interaction to Predict Conflict and Cooperation

Currently under revision.

## What I did:

* Created an R package to convert millions of individual event records into temporal network structures connecting states in the international system.
* Used these positive/negative signed network structures to measure the level and tone of verbal interactions between state governments over a thirty-year period.
* Used verbal tone in a statistical model to predict the onset of material conflict and cooperation in the form of third-party intervention in other states' civil conflicts.

## What I find:
* Verbal interactions are a significant predictor of material cooperation and conflict in the following year, even after controlling for a wide range of variables common in the international relations literature.
* Including verbal interactions in statistical models improves model fit on out-of-sample testing data, indicating that this approach has predictive power rather than simply over-fitting to the observed data.
