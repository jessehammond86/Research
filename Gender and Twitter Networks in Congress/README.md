# Twitter and the Professionalization of Women in Congress

Currently under revise-and-resubmit for the _Journal of Information Technology & Politics_, with Yoonjung Lee.

## What we did:

* Scraped the Twitter history of the 114th US House of Representatives.
* Used natural language processing tools to build sentiment-weighted networks of direct engagement between legislators.
* Fitted exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to the Congressional Twitter network to understand how female legislators use social media to engage with colleagues and leadership.

## What we find:
* Female legislators use Twitter at a higher rate than male legislators.
* Female legislators are more likely to engage with other female legislators, leading to a distinct gender clustering effect in Twitter communication.
* Female legislators are more likely to engage with House leadership.
* Overall, female legislators seem to use Twitter in significantly different ways than male legislators.
