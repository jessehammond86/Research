 The agent for pitcher Frank Viola says the Boston Red Sox are waiting for a final test before giving full medical clearance to the star left- hander. That could clear the way for the free agent's three-year, $ 13.9- million contract to take effect... .
San Francisco Giants pitching coach Norm Sherry, who once coached the Expos, was named manager of the National League baseball club's Class-A affiliate, the Everett Giants in Everett, Wash.
FOOTBALL
Nearly 1,200 Denver Broncos playoff tickets were sold Sunday, cutting the number of unsold tickets to about 7,400 for Saturday's game against Houston at Mile High Stadium.
If the remaining tickets aren't sold by 2 p.m. tomorrow - 72 hours before kickoff - the game could be blacked out in a 120-kilometre radius... .
Wide receiver Michael Haynes of the Atlanta Falcons and safety Deron Cherry of the Kansas City Chiefs were named the NFL offensive and defensive players of the week, respectively, for the wild-card playoff games. 
Haynes caught six passes for 144 yards and two touchdowns when the Falcons defeated New Orleans 27-20 Saturday. Cherry had eight tackles and two interceptions as Kansas City defeated the Los Angeles Raiders 10-6 Saturday... .
Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson will stick with quarterback Steve Beuerlein for Sunday's playoff game against the Detroit Lions. That leaves Troy Aikman the backup. Beuerlein is 5-0 as a starter since Aikman injured his knee last month... .
Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Chris Martin underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee yesterday and is lost for the season.
BASKETBALL
Washington Bullets centre Pervis Ellison was injured in a minor car accident and is listed in stable condition.
Ellison, 24, who suffered neck and back injuries, was injured en route to the Bullets' game against the San Antonio Spurs... .
Scottie Pippen of the Chicago Bulls, who averaged 25.6 points per game in three victories last week, was named NBA player of the week yesterday.
Pippen also averaged 8.6 rebounds, 8.0 assists and 4.6 steals in the three games. He is among the top 16 players in the league in scoring, assists and steals.
Other players nominated for the award were Derrick Coleman of New Jersey, Horace Grant of Chicago, Brad Daugherty of Cleveland, Kendall Gill of Charlotte, Chris Mullin of Golden State, Charles Smith of the Los Angeles Clippers and Xavier McDaniel of New York.
MISCELLANY
The McGill Redmen hockey team ran its record to 3-0 on its tour of Germany with a 7-2 victory over Lahr Selects. Scoring for the winners were Kai Joslin, Guy Boucher, Patrice Tremblay, Stacey McGregor, Dave Hayden, Martin Olivier and Luc Latulippe. The Redmen's next game is Thursday in France... .
About 8,000 men and 2,000 women from 17 countries will compete today in the traditional St. Silvester road race in Sao Paulo.
The race distance has been increased to 15 kilometres from 12.5 kilometres.
The favorites in the men's division are Mexico's Arturo Barrios and Kenya's John Ngugi... .
A men's World Cup slalom race that was cancelled at St. Anton, Austria, was rescheduled for Jan. 13 at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.
The slalom will follow a downhill and a super-giant slalom Jan. 11 and Jan. 12, respectively. With the downhill, the slalom also will count as a combination, an event that awards World Cup points to the top finishers in both events.
The slalom originally was scheduled Dec. 22 at St. Anton, but was cancelled because of bad weather.
try.
But the country's exceedingly desperate economic situation may be difficult to overcome by any government. Mohammad Said, a leading Islamic Front figure, described the country it stands to inherit as "poisoned gifts."
The Islamic Front also cannot overlook the fact that many of the Algerians who voted it into power, including many of the poor and the devout, are totally tuned in to western Europe.
There is no talk here, as there is in Iran, of "Western devils." Western Europe, which lies just across the Mediterranean Sea, is envied and resented at the same time, but remains the stuff of which Algerian dreams are made.
The influence of Italy and Spain, but most of all France, which ruled this country for 130 years, is constantly hammered home by the flashy European television programs seen in more than 60 per cent of Algerian homes. Western Europe's culture, consumerism, and sociopolitical views impinge heavily on Algerian society.
France eventually left this country in 1962, the loser of a bloody eight-year war of liberation that won Algeria the respect and admiration of the Arab world and much of the Third World. But along with the milllion and a half "martyrs" they killed here, the French also left behind their language and a cadre of highly educated people whose love-hate relationship with French culture has shaped Algeria.
While most Iranians do not know any foreign languages, and so remain dependent on the ayatollahs to tell them what the world thinks, virtually all of Algeria's 26 million people speak French. Half this country gets its news from French sources. Four million Algerians live in France, Spain, and Italy, travelling back and forth to Algeria.
One open question here is whether the Algerian army will interfere in the process of democratization. The army, known as the Algerian Liberation Army as a reminder of the reason for its creation in 1954, has distanced itself from the disgraced party in the past two years.
The army has made it clear that it will limit its interference to what it calls "the defence of the constitution," not the defence of the National Front government of President Chadli Benjedid.

Out[20]: '5 of 669 DOCUMENTS\nThe Associated Press\nDecember 30, 1991, Monday, PM cycle\nFrance Seeks Close Ties With Algeria Regardless of Vote Result\nSECTION: International News\nLENGTH: 344 words\nDATELINE: PARIS\n France is committed to deeper ties with Algeria regardless of whether Islamic fundamentalists take control of Parliament, the Foreign Ministry said today.\nIn the first official government comment on last week\'s legislative voting in Algeria, ministry spokesman Daniel Bernard said France was pleased that democratic elections had taken place for the first time since its former colony gained independence in 1962.\nBernard declined to assess the results of Thursday\'s first-round vote, in which the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front won 187 seats in the 430-seat National Assembly, 29 short of a majority. \nThe National Liberation Front, which ruled Algeria as a one-party Marxist state for 29 years, finished third with only 16 seats, according to the latest official results. The liberal Front for Socialist Forces came in second with 20 seats.\nA runoff will be held Jan. 16 for seats in which no first-round candidate won a majority.\n"Whatever the choice of the Algerian people, the relations which unite them with the French people are so close in all areas that they must be maintained," Bernard said. "France will remain committed to deepening them."\nIn editorials Monday, major French newspapers expressed pessimism about Algeria\'s prospects.\nThe Parisian daily France-Soir said Algeria would "gallop toward Iranization" if the army remained passive, yet warned of bloody unrest if the army tried to oppose the fundamentalists.\nLe Figaro, a prominent conservative daily, said the fundamentalists were likely to replace military dictatorship with religious dictatorship without solving the country\'s serious economic problems.\nThe Islamic Front "risks being forced to feed Algerians with words," Le Figaro said.\nThe prospect of fundamentalist rule has raised fears in France that huge numbers of Algerians may seek to flee across the Mediterranean.\nAn estimated 700,000 Algerians already live in France, part of a community of Muslim immigrants numbering 3.5 million. Their integration is this secular country\'s most volatile social issue.\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nCopyright 1991 Associated Press \nAll Rights Reserved\n6 of 669 DOCUMENTS\nThe Globe and Mail (Canada)\nDecember 30, 1991 Monday\nAlgeria   divided   by vote   Secular forces   cling to power\nBYLINE: PATRICK MARTIN; GAM\nLENGTH: 683 words\nDATELINE: Algiers ALGERIA \nBY PATRICK MARTIN\nMiddle East Bureau\n  ALGIERS\n Battle lines were drawn in Algeria yesterday as government and secular\nopposition forces made it clear they would fight hard to prevent the\nfundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) from taking power.\n    The FIS took a giant step toward forming an Islamic state last\nThursday, when it captured 167 of the 206 seats in the country\'s first\nmulti-party parliamentary election. The Islamists need only 49 more seats\nto form a majority government in the 430-seat National Assembly. \nConstituencies in which a majority winner was not elected on Thursday\nwill send their two leading candidates into runoff elections scheduled for\nJan. 16. FIS candidates placed first or second in almost every one of the\nrunoff constituencies, and few believe the party can be denied a majority.\nThe ruling National Liberation Front (FLN), which has governed Algeria\nas a one-party state since independence in 1962, and the Socialist Front\n(FFS), the country\'s third most popular party, have other ideas. The FLN\nwon only 16 seats Thursday and the FFS 20, while independents captured\nthree.\n"A lot can happen before Jan. 16," one senior adviser to the government\nsaid yesterday. A lot already has.\nOn Saturday, amid newspaper headlines that described the FIS success as\nan "earthquake," the government reported it had received complaints of\n"irregularities" in as many as 50 ridings and that the matter had been\nturned over to election officials for investigation. All constituencies in\nquestion, it appears, were won by the FIS.\n"I think we will see the number of contested results increase," the\ngovernment adviser said - to the point that the Jan. 16 runoffs "may have\nto be postponed." He shrugged when asked to explain how voting could be\nfixed in favour of the opposition when government officials had controlled\nthe ballot boxes.\nYesterday, the governing FLN called on all "democratic" parties to join\ntogether to stop the fundamentalists. "The situation can be redeemed if\nparties that consider themselves democrats act, if they manage to focus on\nthe real stakes," Prime Minister Sid Ahmed Ghozaly told French television.\nThe FLN said it hopes that a bigger voter turnout - only 59 per cent of\neligible voters cast ballots Thursday - will prevent the FIS from winning\nmany more seats.\nFFS leader Hossein Ait Ahmed called on Algerians yesterday to march on\nthe capital Thursday in a demonstration of support for democracy and\nopposition to the FIS.\nThe fear many Algerians express is that the FIS, which campaigned on a\nsimple platform of bringing Sharia (Islamic law) to Algeria, will abandon\ndemocracy just as it was getting under way. Several FIS leaders have\nargued that "democracy" is a word that does not appear in the Koran nor in\nthe Arabic dictionary.\nSome people complain that the party would limit the role of women in\nsociety. "It\'s horrible," a 29-year-old woman named Samira said. "They\nwill force me to give up my job and stay at home, and to wear a veil when\nI go out."\nOthers say they fear FIS will undo badly needed economic reforms and\nmake prosperity more difficult to achieve. "Who would want to invest in\nsuch an unpredictable country?" one Western diplomat asked. "Who would be\nwilling to lend it money?"\nFIS\'s interim leader, Abdel Kader Hachani, tried to reassure Algerians\non these points on the weekend. He told a French interviewer that "Algeria\nmust work with all political forces existing in the world and we cannot\nimagine today or tomorrow Algeria being totally isolated from the world\naround it."\nHe told a press conference yesterday, however, that his party was "not\ngoing to give concessions" in applying its strict Islamic program.\nAlgerian newspapers reported yesterday that pressure from the Armed\nForces was building for President Chadli Benjedid to intervene before it\nis too late.\nOne Arab ambassador said yesterday he was certain the president would\nact. "The only question," he said, "is whether the army will be called in\nbefore the second round (of elections) or after."\nSeveral Western diplomats, however, argued that Mr. Benjedid was too\ncommitted to democratic reforms to turn back now.\nLOAD-DATE: January 9, 2007\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\n'

The Islamists need only 49 more seats\nto form a majority government in the 430-seat National Assembly. \nConstituencies in which a majority winner was not elected on Thursday\nwill send their two leading candidates into runoff elections scheduled for\nJan. 16.

He shrugged when asked to explain how voting could be\nfixed in favour of the opposition when government officials had controlled\nthe ballot boxes.\nYesterday, the governing FLN called on all "democratic" parties to join\ntogether to stop the fundamentalists. "The situation can be redeemed if\nparties that consider themselves democrats act, if they manage to focus on\nthe real stakes," Prime Minister Sid Ahmed Ghozaly told French television.\nThe FLN said it hopes that a bigger voter turnout - only 59 per cent of\neligible voters cast ballots Thursday - will prevent the FIS from winning\nmany more seats.\nFFS leader Hossein Ait Ahmed called on Algerians yesterday to march on\nthe capital Thursday in a demonstration of support for democracy and\nopposition to the FIS.\nThe fear many Algerians express is that the FIS, which campaigned on a\nsimple platform of bringing Sharia (Islamic law) to Algeria, will abandon\ndemocracy just as it was getting under way.

Out[43]: '\xef\xbb\xbf\n\n1 of 669 DOCUMENTS\n\nThe Gazette (Montreal, Quebec)\n\nDecember 31, 1991, Tuesday, FINAL EDITION\n\nSox want final test for Viola\n\nSECTION: SPORTS; SPORTS SHORTS; Pg. F3\n\nLENGTH: 949 words\n\n \n The agent for pitcher Frank Viola says the Boston Red Sox are waiting for a final test before giving full medical clearance to the star left- hander. That could clear the way for the free agent\'s three-year, $ 13.9- million contract to take effect... .\nSan Francisco Giants pitching coach Norm Sherry, who once coached the Expos, was named manager of the National League baseball club\'s Class-A affiliate, the Everett Giants in Everett, Wash.\nFOOTBALL\nNearly 1,200 Denver Broncos playoff tickets were sold Sunday, cutting the number of unsold tickets to about 7,400 for Saturday\'s game against Houston at Mile High Stadium.\nIf the remaining tickets aren\'t sold by 2 p.m. tomorrow - 72 hours before kickoff - the game could be blacked out in a 120-kilometre radius... .\nWide receiver Michael Haynes of the Atlanta Falcons and safety Deron Cherry of the Kansas City Chiefs were named the NFL offensive and defensive players of the week, respectively, for the wild-card playoff games. \nHaynes caught six passes for 144 yards and two touchdowns when the Falcons defeated New Orleans 27-20 Saturday. Cherry had eight tackles and two interceptions as Kansas City defeated the Los Angeles Raiders 10-6 Saturday... .\nCowboys coach Jimmy Johnson will stick with quarterback Steve Beuerlein for Sunday\'s playoff game against the Detroit Lions. That leaves Troy Aikman the backup. Beuerlein is 5-0 as a starter since Aikman injured his knee last month... .\nKansas City Chiefs linebacker Chris Martin underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee yesterday and is lost for the season.\nBASKETBALL\nWashington Bullets centre Pervis Ellison was injured in a minor car accident and is listed in stable condition.\nEllison, 24, who suffered neck and back injuries, was injured en route to the Bullets\' game against the San Antonio Spurs... .\nScottie Pippen of the Chicago Bulls, who averaged 25.6 points per game in three victories last week, was named NBA player of the week yesterday.\nPippen also averaged 8.6 rebounds, 8.0 assists and 4.6 steals in the three games. He is among the top 16 players in the league in scoring, assists and steals.\nOther players nominated for the award were Derrick Coleman of New Jersey, Horace Grant of Chicago, Brad Daugherty of Cleveland, Kendall Gill of Charlotte, Chris Mullin of Golden State, Charles Smith of the Los Angeles Clippers and Xavier McDaniel of New York.\nMISCELLANY\nThe McGill Redmen hockey team ran its record to 3-0 on its tour of Germany with a 7-2 victory over Lahr Selects. Scoring for the winners were Kai Joslin, Guy Boucher, Patrice Tremblay, Stacey McGregor, Dave Hayden, Martin Olivier and Luc Latulippe. The Redmen\'s next game is Thursday in France... .\nAbout 8,000 men and 2,000 women from 17 countries will compete today in the traditional St. Silvester road race in Sao Paulo.\nThe race distance has been increased to 15 kilometres from 12.5 kilometres.\nThe favorites in the men\'s division are Mexico\'s Arturo Barrios and Kenya\'s John Ngugi... .\nA men\'s World Cup slalom race that was cancelled at St. Anton, Austria, was rescheduled for Jan. 13 at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.\nThe slalom will follow a downhill and a super-giant slalom Jan. 11 and Jan. 12, respectively. With the downhill, the slalom also will count as a combination, an event that awards World Cup points to the top finishers in both events.\nThe slalom originally was scheduled Dec. 22 at St. Anton, but was cancelled because of bad weather.\ntry.\nBut the country\'s exceedingly desperate economic situation may be difficult to overcome by any government. Mohammad Said, a leading Islamic Front figure, described the country it stands to inherit as "poisoned gifts."\nThe Islamic Front also cannot overlook the fact that many of the Algerians who voted it into power, including many of the poor and the devout, are totally tuned in to western Europe.\nThere is no talk here, as there is in Iran, of "Western devils." Western Europe, which lies just across the Mediterranean Sea, is envied and resented at the same time, but remains the stuff of which Algerian dreams are made.\nThe influence of Italy and Spain, but most of all France, which ruled this country for 130 years, is constantly hammered home by the flashy European television programs seen in more than 60 per cent of Algerian homes. Western Europe\'s culture, consumerism, and sociopolitical views impinge heavily on Algerian society.\nFrance eventually left this country in 1962, the loser of a bloody eight-year war of liberation that won Algeria the respect and admiration of the Arab world and much of the Third World. But along with the milllion and a half "martyrs" they killed here, the French also left behind their language and a cadre of highly educated people whose love-hate relationship with French culture has shaped Algeria.\nWhile most Iranians do not know any foreign languages, and so remain dependent on the ayatollahs to tell them what the world thinks, virtually all of Algeria\'s 26 million people speak French. Half this country gets its news from French sources. Four million Algerians live in France, Spain, and Italy, travelling back and forth to Algeria.\nOne open question here is whether the Algerian army will interfere in the process of democratization. The army, known as the Algerian Liberation Army as a reminder of the reason for its creation in 1954, has distanced itself from the disgraced party in the past two years.\nThe army has made it clear that it will limit its interference to what it calls "the defence of the constitution," not the defence of the National Front government of President Chadli Benjedid.\n\n'

A victory for Algeria's fundamentalists

SECTION: EDITORIAL; EDITORIALS; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 432 words

 
International human-rights advocates cannot help but have an ambivalent reaction to the results of Algeria's first free parliamentary elections.
 
    The very fact that the multiparty elections were held without serious incident represents a triumph for democracy in a nation that had been dominated by one-party rule since winning its independence from France in 1962. However, the surprisingly strong showing of the Islamic Salvation Front, which came close to capturing an absolute majority of parliamentary seats, raises the question of whether Algerians may simply be using the mechanics of the democratic process to create a new form of dictatorship controlled by religious fundamentalists.
 
    For now, President Chadli Bendjedid, who legalized opposition political parties two years ago, still holds the real power in Algeria.  However, Bendjedid's ruling National Liberation Front won only 16 parliamentary seats, compared with 187 for the Islamic Salvation Front. At best, Bendjedid and the army he controls will reach an uneasy alliance with the Islamic fundamentalists to keep the government running until 1993's scheduled presidential elections.  However, if Bendjedid uses his authority to dissolve the parliament, or if the fundamentalists press for early presidential elections, Algeria couldbe plunged into civil war.
 
    In any case, Islamic fundamentalists are likely to gain control of the Algerian government sometime within the next two years. Only then will Algerians be certain how the fundamentalist leaders will reconcile the uncompromising dictates of the Koran with the principles of democratic government.
 
    The leaders of Algeria's Islamic Salvation Front sound as if they are considerably less doctrinaire than the fundamentalists who have controlled the Iranian government for more than a decade.  However, many modern, secular Algerians fear that their political rights will fall victim to religious law once the fundamentalists enjoy real political control.
 
    Whatever its ultimate outcome, Algeria's multiparty political process represents an important sign of progress in a region of the world that has not been eager to embrace democratic values.  However, the expression of popular will in the Islamic world is unlikely to resemble Westerners' idea of democratic society.
 
    Individuals can lose their rights just as easily under a tyranny of the majority as under a one-man dictatorship. That's a lesson that Algerians, like the citizens of long-established democracies, must learn for themselves.

Last New Year's party before Islamic austerity

BYLINE: HASSAN ZENATI

SECTION: News

LENGTH: 676 words

DATELINE: ALGIERS

 Apprehension has dampened the last New Year's celebrations before the Islamic Salvation Front takes over parliament as many wonder how its credo for a return to austerity and rigorous Islamic morality will affect their daily lives.
Immediately after the FIS victory in the first round of Algeria's first free parliamentary last week, one of its leaders Sheikh Mohammed Said signalled the new tone by urging Algerians to "reconsider their dressing and eating habits" and to "repudiate all ostentatious consumption".
For many in the full swing of the holiday season, this quickly brought to mind the violent campaign by Islamic fundamentalists two years ago who wanted to rid bakeries of a traditional Christmas cake in the shape of a log inherited from France during its 30-year rule over Algeria.
Fundamentalist commandos that year also attacked the few hotels and restaurants that dared to defy a ban proclaimed by the mosques on organizing dinners to ring in the New Year. 
In the western city of Telagh, an entire hotel was burned down and several people injured after the building was set aflame by a group crying, "God is great", led by the city's FIS mayor.
Though official results of the first round voting last Thursday were to be given around 1600 GMT Monday, partial results already announced by the interior ministry gave the FIS 167 of the 430 seats.
Islamic leaders claimed 190 of their candidates had been elected.
The second round of voting scheduled for January 16 is expected to give the FIS an absolute majority in the National Assembly, despite some 50 complaints of voting irregularities that have been lodged with the election commission, mostly by independent parties and candidates.
The hotels and restaurants in Algeria's coastal resorts still organize New Year's dinners, but even if they have not cancelled them at the last minute since Thursday's FIS victory they are going about their plans with little publicity.
There are no huge newspaper advertisements nor publicity campaigns by travel agencies. Plain notices give telephone numbers to call for reservations and list menus suggestions for a dinner out with others.
Many others said they have chosen to celebrate the New Year with friends and family in the privacy of their own homes away from the potentially disapproving view of what they called the "bearded men".
The growing hold of Islamic fundamentalism over Algeria in the last 10 years has already considerably reduced the sort of rollicking New Year's celebrations seen in the West.
Speciality gourmet stores selling goose liver and truffles -- an essential part of the French New Year's -- were closed down 20 years ago, and liquor is available only at a high price on the black market where a bottle of whisky goes for 1000 dinars (50 dollars).
Local red wine is available but people start stocking up weeks in advance to avoid arousing suspicion by fundamentalists and conservatives who decry such parties.
Some of the well-off travel quietly to Spain, Italy, France and sometimes Morocco to celebate the New Year, as evidenced by the lines that start up outside consulates for these countries and in travel agencies as the year draws to a close.
The Islamic model advocated by the FIS imams in the fundamentalist mosques is one of austerity, even asceticism, and Islamic religious holidays are celebrated in this tradition.
The faithful are asked to avoid excesses and to assemble inside the mosques to recite the Koran together and listen to sermons.
In the same spirit, marriage ceremonies have also been the subject of decrees by fundamentalist imams who have declared a religious ban on the traditional wedding party cortege full of noise and flowers.
They have urged women notably to adhere to strict, modest dress even when they are not in the presence of men.
Sermons during fundamentalist marriages also stress the "good conduct" of the wife towards her husband, stressing here "duty" to obedience, procreation, fidelity and submission.

France Seeks Close Ties With Algeria Regardless of Vote Result

SECTION: International News

LENGTH: 344 words

DATELINE: PARIS

 France is committed to deeper ties with Algeria regardless of whether Islamic fundamentalists take control of Parliament, the Foreign Ministry said today.
In the first official government comment on last week's legislative voting in Algeria, ministry spokesman Daniel Bernard said France was pleased that democratic elections had taken place for the first time since its former colony gained independence in 1962.
Bernard declined to assess the results of Thursday's first-round vote, in which the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front won 187 seats in the 430-seat National Assembly, 29 short of a majority. 
The National Liberation Front, which ruled Algeria as a one-party Marxist state for 29 years, finished third with only 16 seats, according to the latest official results. The liberal Front for Socialist Forces came in second with 20 seats.
A runoff will be held Jan. 16 for seats in which no first-round candidate won a majority.
"Whatever the choice of the Algerian people, the relations which unite them with the French people are so close in all areas that they must be maintained," Bernard said. "France will remain committed to deepening them."
In editorials Monday, major French newspapers expressed pessimism about Algeria's prospects.
The Parisian daily France-Soir said Algeria would "gallop toward Iranization" if the army remained passive, yet warned of bloody unrest if the army tried to oppose the fundamentalists.
Le Figaro, a prominent conservative daily, said the fundamentalists were likely to replace military dictatorship with religious dictatorship without solving the country's serious economic problems.
The Islamic Front "risks being forced to feed Algerians with words," Le Figaro said.
The prospect of fundamentalist rule has raised fears in France that huge numbers of Algerians may seek to flee across the Mediterranean.
An estimated 700,000 Algerians already live in France, part of a community of Muslim immigrants numbering 3.5 million. Their integration is this secular country's most volatile social issue.

Algeria   divided   by vote   Secular forces   cling to power

BYLINE: PATRICK MARTIN; GAM

LENGTH: 683 words

DATELINE: Algiers ALGERIA 

BY PATRICK MARTIN
Middle East Bureau
  ALGIERS
 Battle lines were drawn in Algeria yesterday as government and secular
opposition forces made it clear they would fight hard to prevent the
fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) from taking power.
    The FIS took a giant step toward forming an Islamic state last
Thursday, when it captured 167 of the 206 seats in the country's first
multi-party parliamentary election. The Islamists need only 49 more seats
to form a majority government in the 430-seat National Assembly. 
Constituencies in which a majority winner was not elected on Thursday
will send their two leading candidates into runoff elections scheduled for
Jan. 16. FIS candidates placed first or second in almost every one of the
runoff constituencies, and few believe the party can be denied a majority.
The ruling National Liberation Front (FLN), which has governed Algeria
as a one-party state since independence in 1962, and the Socialist Front
(FFS), the country's third most popular party, have other ideas. The FLN
won only 16 seats Thursday and the FFS 20, while independents captured
three.
"A lot can happen before Jan. 16," one senior adviser to the government
said yesterday. A lot already has.
On Saturday, amid newspaper headlines that described the FIS success as
an "earthquake," the government reported it had received complaints of
"irregularities" in as many as 50 ridings and that the matter had been
turned over to election officials for investigation. All constituencies in
question, it appears, were won by the FIS.
"I think we will see the number of contested results increase," the
government adviser said - to the point that the Jan. 16 runoffs "may have
to be postponed." He shrugged when asked to explain how voting could be
fixed in favour of the opposition when government officials had controlled
the ballot boxes.
Yesterday, the governing FLN called on all "democratic" parties to join
together to stop the fundamentalists. "The situation can be redeemed if
parties that consider themselves democrats act, if they manage to focus on
the real stakes," Prime Minister Sid Ahmed Ghozaly told French television.
The FLN said it hopes that a bigger voter turnout - only 59 per cent of
eligible voters cast ballots Thursday - will prevent the FIS from winning
many more seats.
FFS leader Hossein Ait Ahmed called on Algerians yesterday to march on
the capital Thursday in a demonstration of support for democracy and
opposition to the FIS.
The fear many Algerians express is that the FIS, which campaigned on a
simple platform of bringing Sharia (Islamic law) to Algeria, will abandon
democracy just as it was getting under way. Several FIS leaders have
argued that "democracy" is a word that does not appear in the Koran nor in
the Arabic dictionary.
Some people complain that the party would limit the role of women in
society. "It's horrible," a 29-year-old woman named Samira said. "They
will force me to give up my job and stay at home, and to wear a veil when
I go out."
Others say they fear FIS will undo badly needed economic reforms and
make prosperity more difficult to achieve. "Who would want to invest in
such an unpredictable country?" one Western diplomat asked. "Who would be
willing to lend it money?"
FIS's interim leader, Abdel Kader Hachani, tried to reassure Algerians
on these points on the weekend. He told a French interviewer that "Algeria
must work with all political forces existing in the world and we cannot
imagine today or tomorrow Algeria being totally isolated from the world
around it."
He told a press conference yesterday, however, that his party was "not
going to give concessions" in applying its strict Islamic program.
Algerian newspapers reported yesterday that pressure from the Armed
Forces was building for President Chadli Benjedid to intervene before it
is too late.
One Arab ambassador said yesterday he was certain the president would
act. "The only question," he said, "is whether the army will be called in
before the second round (of elections) or after."
Several Western diplomats, however, argued that Mr. Benjedid was too
committed to democratic reforms to turn back now.

the ballot boxes.
Yesterday, the governing FLN called on all "democratic" parties to join
together to stop the fundamentalists. "The situation can be redeemed if
parties that consider themselves democrats act, if they manage to focus on
the real stakes," Prime Minister Sid Ahmed Ghozaly told French television.
The FLN said it hopes that a bigger voter turnout - only 59 per cent of
eligible voters cast ballots Thursday - will prevent the FIS from winning
many more seats.
FFS leader Hossein Ait Ahmed called on Algerians yesterday to march on
the capital Thursday in a demonstration of support for democracy and
opposition to the FIS.
The fear many Algerians express is that the FIS, which campaigned on a
simple platform of bringing Sharia (Islamic law) to Algeria, will abandon
democracy just as it was getting under way. Several FIS leaders have
argued that "democracy" is a word that does not appear in the Koran nor in
the Arabic dictionary.
Some people complain that the party would limit the role of women in
society. "It's horrible," a 29-year-old woman named Samira said. "They
will force me to give up my job and stay at home, and to wear a veil when
I go out."
Others say they fear FIS will undo badly needed economic reforms and
make prosperity more difficult to achieve. "Who would want to invest in
such an unpredictable country?" one Western diplomat asked. "Who would be
willing to lend it money?"
FIS's interim leader, Abdel Kader Hachani, tried to reassure Algerians
on these points on the weekend. He told a French interviewer that "Algeria
must work with all political forces existing in the world and we cannot
imagine today or tomorrow Algeria being totally isolated from the world
around it."
He told a press conference yesterday, however, that his party was "not
going to give concessions" in applying its strict Islamic program.
Algerian newspapers reported yesterday that pressure from the Armed
Forces was building for President Chadli Benjedid to intervene before it
is too late.
One Arab ambassador said yesterday he was certain the president would
act. "The only question," he said, "is whether the army will be called in
before the second round (of elections) or after."
Several Western diplomats, however, argued that Mr. Benjedid was too
committed to democratic reforms to turn back now.

Mandela OKs temporary white bloc in parliament

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 432 words

 Anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela said Sunday South African whites could be guaranteed a bloc of seats in Parliament for a limited period, but he made clear the concept of majority rule is not negotiable. Mandela's African national Congress, the government and 17 other political organizations began official negotiations on a new constitution Dec. 20. The next meeting is in March. Conservative whites groups that oppose reform vow to wage war rather than accept a black government. 
 SHAMIR RESIGNATION? The resignation of Israeli Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan triggered speculation Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir could also quit in a bid to force early elections - now due in November. Holding them early could slow Middle East peace talks that resume in Washington Jan. 7. Meanwhile, a senior Israeli official told the Reuters news agency in Jerusalem that the Israeli government - in a move sure to be criticized by the USA - bowed to the demands of ultra-rightists and agreed to spend most of its 1992 housing budget on homes for settlers in occupied Arab territories.
 SWISS-IRAN PROBLEM: Switzerland closed its embassy in Tehran after Iran stopped a Swiss diplomat from leaving Iran. The move also interrupted U.S. relations with Iran, since the Swiss have represented U.S. interests there since the U.S. Embassy was seized in November 1979.
 CHINA NUCLEAR PACT: Chinese legislators voted to sign the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty. China was until now the only one of the five declared nuclear powers that had not accepted the treaty's terms.
 CAMBODIAN RETURNS: Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan, thrown out of the Cambodian capital last month by angry crowds, returns today to resume efforts to carry out the country's U.N.-supervised peace accord. The government promised troops would guard him from attack.
 ELSEWHERE: Algeria's fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front, poised to take control of parliament after its overwhelming electoral victory Friday, called for reconciliation with its opponents and told the world it would respect Algeria's international commitments ... President Saddam Hussein's son-in- law, sacked as Iraqi defense minister last month, reappeared at a meeting with the Iraqi leader. Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel Hassan attended a meeting between Saddam and industry ministers and experts ... Haitian lawmakers remain split over how to resolve the political and economic crisis created by the army's ouster three months ago of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Negotiations over Aristide's return enter a crucial stage this week.

France Seeks Close Ties With Algeria Regardless of Vote Result

SECTION: International News

LENGTH: 344 words

DATELINE: PARIS

 France is committed to deeper ties with Algeria regardless of whether Islamic fundamentalists take control of Parliament, the Foreign Ministry said today.
In the first official government comment on last week's legislative voting in Algeria, ministry spokesman Daniel Bernard said France was pleased that democratic elections had taken place for the first time since its former colony gained independence in 1962.
Bernard declined to assess the results of Thursday's first-round vote, in which the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front won 187 seats in the 430-seat National Assembly, 29 short of a majority. 
The National Liberation Front, which ruled Algeria as a one-party Marxist state for 29 years, finished third with only 16 seats, according to the latest official results. The liberal Front for Socialist Forces came in second with 20 seats.
A runoff will be held Jan. 16 for seats in which no first-round candidate won a majority.
"Whatever the choice of the Algerian people, the relations which unite them with the French people are so close in all areas that they must be maintained," Bernard said. "France will remain committed to deepening them."
In editorials Monday, major French newspapers expressed pessimism about Algeria's prospects.
The Parisian daily France-Soir said Algeria would "gallop toward Iranization" if the army remained passive, yet warned of bloody unrest if the army tried to oppose the fundamentalists.
Le Figaro, a prominent conservative daily, said the fundamentalists were likely to replace military dictatorship with religious dictatorship without solving the country's serious economic problems.
The Islamic Front "risks being forced to feed Algerians with words," Le Figaro said.
The prospect of fundamentalist rule has raised fears in France that huge numbers of Algerians may seek to flee across the Mediterranean.
An estimated 700,000 Algerians already live in France, part of a community of Muslim immigrants numbering 3.5 million. Their integration is this secular country's most volatile social issue.

Algeria   divided   by vote   Secular forces   cling to power

BYLINE: PATRICK MARTIN; GAM

LENGTH: 683 words

DATELINE: Algiers ALGERIA 

BY PATRICK MARTIN
Middle East Bureau
  ALGIERS
 Battle lines were drawn in Algeria yesterday as government and secular
opposition forces made it clear they would fight hard to prevent the
fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) from taking power.
    The FIS took a giant step toward forming an Islamic state last
Thursday, when it captured 167 of the 206 seats in the country's first
multi-party parliamentary election. The Islamists need only 49 more seats
to form a majority government in the 430-seat National Assembly. 
Constituencies in which a majority winner was not elected on Thursday
will send their two leading candidates into runoff elections scheduled for
Jan. 16. FIS candidates placed first or second in almost every one of the
runoff constituencies, and few believe the party can be denied a majority.
The ruling National Liberation Front (FLN), which has governed Algeria
as a one-party state since independence in 1962, and the Socialist Front
(FFS), the country's third most popular party, have other ideas. The FLN
won only 16 seats Thursday and the FFS 20, while independents captured
three.
"A lot can happen before Jan. 16," one senior adviser to the government
said yesterday. A lot already has.
On Saturday, amid newspaper headlines that described the FIS success as
an "earthquake," the government reported it had received complaints of
"irregularities" in as many as 50 ridings and that the matter had been
turned over to election officials for investigation. All constituencies in
question, it appears, were won by the FIS.
"I think we will see the number of contested results increase," the
government adviser said - to the point that the Jan. 16 runoffs "may have
to be postponed." He shrugged when asked to explain how voting could be
fixed in favour of the opposition when government officials had controlled
the ballot boxes.
Yesterday, the governing FLN called on all "democratic" parties to join
together to stop the fundamentalists. "The situation can be redeemed if

the real stakes," Prime Minister Sid Ahmed Ghozaly told French television.
