# Military-strategic Updating During Civil Conflict

It's my dissertation!

## What I did:

* Created a theory arguing that weaker groups will be more successful in civil wars if they can update their military strategy more quickly and more optimally than stronger state forces.
* Hand-coded roughly 18,000 violent events from the Troubles in Northern Ireland and the Second Intifada in Israel/Palestine according to location, type of violence, initiator/target, and outcome.
* Used a variety of statistical models to test action/reaction patterns between state and insurgent forces.

## What I found:
* There is little evidence to support the idea that week-to-week or month-to-month updating occurs. Instead, state forces tend to act the same way over long periods of time (static strategy), while insurgents tend to act unpredictably over time (random strategy). This makes some sense: if insurgent behaviors could be explained and predicted, then it would be much easier for stronger state forces to engage and destroy them.
* Instead, strategy changes in fits and starts, often linked to a corresponding political shift. For example, Israeli strategy in combating insurgency in the Gaza Strip and West Bank changed significantly with the election of Mahmoud Abbas, who ran on a pro-peace platform and sought and end to violence.
* In a large-_N_ study of conflict duration and outcome, I find that insurgents that can change their military strategy more quickly relative to states are likely to survive longer, extending the duration of conflict.
