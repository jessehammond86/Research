# Previous research projects

Scripts, replication information, and metadata for some of the research projects I've done in the past.

## List of projects

### Data Science in Digital Business (with Bill Fox)
We introduce and illustrate use-cases for a range of common linear and non-linear statistical models, and provide example code for implementing these models in the R work environment. Finally, we provide some guidance on robustness checking and model fit assessment through residuals analysis.

### Assessing Event Data in Conflict (with Nils Weidmann)
An in-depth comparison of three conflict event data sets - ACLED, GED, and GDELT - over a set of civil conflicts in the past two decades. We find that while micro-level event data is useful in explaining and predicting violence, there is a high level of discrepancy between the three data sets, despite their nominally measuring the same type of underlying 'ground truth'.

### Sentiment in British political cables leading up to World War I (with Randy Siverson)
Automated sentiment analysis of an unclassified trove of British political cables in the months leading up to World War I. We set out to understand how British leadership viewed the situation on the Continent, and if the outbreak of war was truly a surprise to those involved.

### Cheap Talk in Diplomatic Networks
I leverage recently released data on political interactions between states to generate de-facto networks of cooperation and conflict that evolve over time. I find that cheap talk seems to matter: a change in the tone of verbal engagement (accusations, threats, and disagreements) is a strong predictor of material conflict up to and including war.

### Gender and Twitter Networks in Congress (with Yoonjung Lee)
We scrape publicly available Twitter data for all members of the 114th US House of Representatives, code sentiment weighting and direction in Representatives' tweets, and build networks of positive and negative engagement within the Congress. We find that female Representatives not only use Twitter more to communicate with their fellow legislators, but that they are more likely to engage other female Representatives and leaders in the House.

### Updating Strategy in War
I create two detailed event-level data sets on armed conflict in Northern Ireland and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and use spatial analysis and autoregressive time-series modeling to examine how state forces and insurgencies both change the way they fight in response to one another over time.
