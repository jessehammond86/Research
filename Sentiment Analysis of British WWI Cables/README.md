# 1914 Revisited: An Exploration in Automated Content Analysis of the Effect of Communications from European Capitals on British Decision Makers

Currently under revision, with Randy Siverson

## What we did:

* Leveraged the Stanford Political Dictionary, one of the few sentiment dictionaries specifically designed for political analysis, to code sentiment weightings of British classified cables in the months leading up to World War I.
* Examined whether the tone used to discuss aggressor states (Austria-Hungary and Germany) changed significantly leading up to the outbreak of conflict, to see if British legislators were truly caught off-guard by the war.

## What we find:
* Automated sentiment analysis shows a sharp turn towards negative perception of Germany and Austria-Hungary, with a corresponding increase in positive perception towards France.
* The change in sentiment occurs very close to the outbreak of conflict, suggesting that although British leaders were forewarned, this was a matter of weeks/days rather than months.
