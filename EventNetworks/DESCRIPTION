Description: This package downloads daily Phoenix event data (time range set
    by user) into a set of temp files. Event data are merged and de-duplicated,
    then turned into daily network objects by event-code or event-root-code. The
    resulting set of networks is saved as a (very) large list object, organized by
    event-code and then by date.
