update_phoenix(destpath)
}
\arguments{
\item{destpath}{The path to download Phoenix into.}
}
\description{
Checks the contents of a directory containing Phoenix event data files, checks whether the
server has new events, and downloads them to that directory. (It'll have some version handling ability,
too, either from the file names or by reading in the events.)

This function, like Phoenix, is still in development and may contain errors and change quickly.
