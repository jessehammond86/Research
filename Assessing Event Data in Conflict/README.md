# Using Machine-coded Event Data for the Micro-level Study of Political Violence

Published in _Research & Politics_ 1.2 (2014), with Nils Weidmann

## What we did:

* Compared a major machine-coded event data set (the Global Events, Locations, and Tone dataset, or GDELT) to two hand-coded event data sets studying battles and violence during civil wars.
* Assessed the viability of low-cost, automatically coded event data for tracking spatial and substantive trends in civil war violence.

## What we find:
* While GDELT's coding rate and sheer volume of data is impressive, its geo-coding algorithm is highly inaccurate compared to hand-coded data sets.
* Substantively, the number and timing of GDELT events is also inconsistent with hand-coded data sets.
* Overall, this iteration of fully automated event-coding processes is not ready for the fine-grained analysis of civil war violence.
